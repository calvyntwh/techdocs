## 2. BCB Testnet

The BCB testnet is provided by the BCB Team and is designed for users to develop, debug and test. Everyone can apply BCB on the testnet for free through the official website.

All block data on the testnet is independent of the mainnet. Developers should develop and debug on the testnet first, and then migrate to the mainnet to run after the development is completed.
