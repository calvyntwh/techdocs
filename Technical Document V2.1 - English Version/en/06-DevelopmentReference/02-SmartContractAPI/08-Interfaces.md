In short, this block has nothing to do with the currently executed smart contract call) generated above the last block on the blockchain (block height plus 1).
> In the deliverTx phase, the transaction that invoked the smart contract has reached a consensus on the blockchain and is written to the latest block. At this point, ISmartContract::Block() is called to get the latest real-time information on the blockchain.

An exception is generated when any of the following conditions is met. When an exception occurs, the SDK will automatically trigger a `panic`:

> - The contract interface that called the interface was called across contracts.
> - All elements in the target chain ID list are invalid chain IDs.
> - The chain has not deployed an IBC contract or the IBC contract has not taken effect.
> - IBC contract transaction registration interface processing produced an error.

### 17.5 func Broadcast()

Function Prototype:

```go
func (IIBCHelper) Broadcast() types.Hash

### 17.6 func CalcBlockHash()

Function Prototype:

```go
func (IIBCHelper) CalcBlockHash(h *ibc.Header) types.Hash
```

Calculate block hash based on block header. `h` is the block header object.

An exception is generated when any of the following conditions is met. When an exception occurs, the SDK will automatically trigger a `panic`:

> - The block header object is nil.
> - The time string in the block header is not in the correct format.

### 17.7 func CalcQueueHash()

Function Prototype:

```go
func (IIBCHelper) CalcQueueHash(packet ibc.Packet, lastQueueHash types.Hash) types.Hash
```

Calculate the current node hash of the queue based on the message data and the previous queue hash. `packet` is the current message value. `lastQueueHash` is the last Hash queue node.

### 17.8 func VerifyPrecommit()

Function Prototype:

```go
func (IIBCHelper) VerifyPrecommit(
    pubKey types.PubKey,
    precommit ibc.Precommit,
    chainID string,
    height int64) bool
```

Verify block proof data. `pubKey` is the public key value of the initiating chain verifier node. `precommit` Voting data for the initiating chain validator node. `chainID` is the originating chain ID. `height` The block height of the initiation chain to initiate cross-chain transaction proof data.

An exception is generated when any of the following conditions is met. When an exception occurs, the SDK will automatically trigger a `panic`:

> - The time string in the voting information is not in the correct format.

## 18 sdk/IIBCStubHelper
